# Sorting-Tool

This is a project made out of my own desire to get better at sorting algorithms.  I thought it would be fun to make a tool to compare different sorting algorithms
and provide a nice command line interface to play around with everything.  It's also a good excuse to play around a bit with `getopt()`.

# Usage

The planned usage will follow the form of `Sort [algorithm 1] [algorithm 2] [size of array]` which will generate an array with the given number of elements, then
perform both sorting algorithms on the same generated array.  It will then output information about each sorting algorithm and how well each performed on the array.
