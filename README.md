# Sorting-Sandbox

This is a project I've had in my head for a bit.  I've always thought that it would be cool to have a program that could compare different sorting algorithms.  I'm 
also pretty bad with sorting algorithms in general, so this is also an opportunity to get some more practice with writing out sorting algorithms.  It's also a way
to parctice some fork()/exec()/wait(), and pthread stuff too.  This is half partially useful CS tool and half experiment in trying out linux system programming 
concepts. I'm using it as a way to have some fun.

# Usage

The planned usage will follow the form of `Sort [algorithm 1] [algorithm 2] [size of array]` which will generate an array with the given number of elements, then
perform both sorting algorithms on the same generated array.  It will then output information about each sorting algorithm and how well each performed on the array.
